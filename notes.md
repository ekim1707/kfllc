"Be the Father to the Fatherless"

There's a lot of "me first" in this world, and it's only natural for things to operate egocentrically when human beings are innately built with one mind and one heart feeding all of their thoughts and ambitions. The number one instinct of all living things is survival and sustainability; it only makes sense that individuals are naturally inclined to "take care of #1" or "get their own" ahead of all else.

I start with this intro because I find myself guilty of it all the time, and I'm always wary of falling into that trap with anything I try to do, no matter how good I think my intentions are the entire time. If I err wrong with my intentions with the LLC, or rub anyone the wrong way in the process of attempting to fulfill these intentions, then I can only accept blame and apologize in advance.

My mother and father started this LLC in June of 2008 (which coincidentally is also the month of my birthday) with one true intention: to provide a stable future for my sister and I. To provide financial sustainability for us that would persist even after they are no longer alive and able to care for us in person.

The more I think about it now, the more I truly beleive in my own heart that it was all mostly for me, and not necessarily my sister. That probably comes off in a way that I don't intend... what I really mean is, anyone who knows my sister well, including myself, knows how amazingly capable and independant she is on her own. To me personally, and I mean this in the most honest and genuine way possible, she has always been one of the most ambitious and impressive people in the business world I have ever met in my entire life, and I can't really concede that anyone, including my parents, would have any real concern about her long-term financial future.

In contrast, anybody who knows me well would easily be able to tell you that I have always been (and continue to be) quite the opposite. In general, I have usually been one step too short, one inch too small.. just never really able to figure life out or take care of myself capably whatsoever.

I really think that my parents just began to worry that I might never be able to find a stable career some day. They didn't want to leave this world unsure or worried about me, so they built this entire LLC with the idea that it would take care of me indefinitely, no matter what happened in my life outside of it.

I remember many talks with my father during some of my particularly trying times, when I would tell him how discouraged I was about my future. My father would always encourage the crap out of me, but near the end, he almost always mentioned how at the very worst, I would earn through the LLC on a yearly basis what the average person would make through their yearly salary. And this without me even really having to work for it.

The LLC has now grown to a level now where it can possibly do some good for others in the world who need support, and not just for me. My family understands the importance of privacy and safety more than anyone, especially in today's often manipulative and untrustful world. At the same time, my current thought is that if we keep playing everything as safely and under-the-radar as possible, then at the end of the day, there's really not much true meaning in even having the LLC to begin with.

Some time ago, I considered changing the name of the LLC to something more generic or possibly more  appealing to the general public. Ironically, my father was thinking the same thing as me. I had a quite drastic change of heart after some thought, however, and as a family we have decided that instead, we would like this name to persist forever.

There could be no two words that better define the LLC to begin with:
(1) Kim (the name of my parents who started it all)
(2) Family

I am constantly reminded these days of how lucky I was to have the amazing parents and family that I was just undeservedly born into. And admist all the pain and suffering that continues to be ignored or go unheard in the world on a daily basis, I am also constantly reminded of how many people were just undeservedly born into this world completely lacking the support that my family gave me. We're all in this together, and we all should be willing to do all that is necessary for the sake of what is right.

My parents could have used all their free time attending fancy dinner parties or purchasing sports cars, like a lot of their social circle did. Instead, while nobody else was paying attention, they toiled away in their office at home to build this LLC for my sister and I.

I will never forget all of their sacrifices and their persistently unconditional and amazing love.

Thank you for your time.
